# First, create a variable called start, and set it equal to "I am ".
# Remember the space after the word "am" !
start = "I am "

# Create a variable called age and set it to your age in years 
# Note: This must be an int, not a string!
age = 60

# Next, create a variable called end, and set it equal to " years old".
# Remember the space before the word "years"
end = " years old"

# Create output text"
# Next, create a variable called output, and use the format() function to add
# together the start, age and end variables. 
output = '{}{}{}'.format(start, age, end)

# An example output string would be "I am 15 years old"

#Print output to screen
